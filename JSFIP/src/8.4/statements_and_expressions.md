# Statements and Expressions

JS distinguishes two kinds of syntactic constructs - _Statements_ and _Expressions_.

## Statements

A _statement_ is a piece of code which can be executed and performs some kind of action. 
For example, `if` is a statement:

```js
let myStr;
if (myBool) {
  myStr = 'Yes';
} else {
  myStr = 'No';
}
```
